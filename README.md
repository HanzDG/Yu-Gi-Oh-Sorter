Project 5: The Next King of Sorting!

Implementation:
Project 5 gives consists of two parts:

You will modify the DoublyLinkedList class to implement the swap function that swaps 2 elements in a doubly-linked list.

You will modify the CardShop class to implement the following sorting algorithms and their helper functions: bubbleSort, insertionSort, quickSort, mergeSort.

Remember, you must thoroughly document your code and explain your thought process!!!

Task 1: Implementing the swap method for the DoublyLinkedList class
Implement the following method for the DoublyLinkedList class:

/**
  
  @param: i is the index (integer) of the first item we are swapping in the list
  @param: j is the index (integer) of the second item we are swapping in the list
  @pre: i < j
  @post:  swaps the element at position i with the element at position j
  @example we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in our list so calling swap(1,2) will make it:
  1, 3, 2, 4, 5 (note we start from index 0)
*/

Task 2: Implement sorting algorithms for the CardShop class
Now that you can swap things around, implementing the sorting algorithms should be easy.

In your CardShop class you will have 4 sorting functions:

bubbleSort

insertionSort

quickSort

mergeSort

You are only required to implement *3 of the 4* sorting algorithms for full points. You can implement all 4 for extra credit.

Let's look at an example sorting function and consider the parameters and returns all these functions need:
template<typename Comparator>
int bubbleSort(Comparator comp, std::string key);

All sorting functions will take the two parameters described above. NOTE that quickSort and mergeSort too will have only these two parameters, if you need to pass extra arguments you need to write helper functions. 

We want you to be able to sort in both ascending and descending order, so just writing something like if(a > b) and then  swap won't work if we want to sort in the reverse order. We want to write a single function and parameterize whether we use the greater-than or less-than operators. We can use a template to parameterize a function (we pass a function into another function). That is why all the sorting functions will be templated, and will have a template Comparator parameter. 

comp can then be replaced by one of two functions:

std::less<int>{} which compares if the first item is less than the 2nd

This is used for sorting in ascending order.

std::greater<int>{} for if the first item is greater than the 2nd

This is used for sorting in descending order.

Instead of using if a<b or b>a, within the sorting functions you will have if(comp(a,b)). This will then be replaced with either if(a<b or if(a>b) depending on the argument being passed into the function when it is called. 

Next we have what "key" we are sorting by. In our project the possible keys your sorting functions should account for are atk and def. This means the 4 possible ways of sorting the list are as follows:

ascending atk value with function call: bubbleSort(std::less<int>{}, "atk")

descending atk value with function call: bubbleSort(std::greater<int>{}, "atk")

ascending def value with function call: bubbleSort(std::less<int>{}, "def")

descending def value with function call: bubbleSort(std::greater<int>{}, "def")

For grading purposes, all sorting functions MUST RETURN THE NUMBER OF SWAPS performed by the sorting algorithm. In the case of MergeSort, it will return the number of merge operations. 

REMEMBER Parameters and returns will be the same for all sorting functions.

IMPORTANT: Since CardShop has some template functions, it cannot be compiled. You must therefore follow  your usual include rules, except that main.cpp will now include CardShop.cpp instead of CardShop.hpp, so that it can be compiled with the appropriate comparison operator along with main.cpp. 

Make sure to familiarize yourself with every class provided with the starter files before you start coding. You will use these classes to guide you in the implementation and testing of the sorting functions you write. You may write additional helper functions as you see fit.

Testing
How to compile in your Makefile: 
In terminal, in the same directory as your Makefile and your source files, use the following command

make rebuild
This assumes you did not modify or rename the Makefile provided with in the starter code for this project and that it is the only makefile in that directory.

You must always implement and test you programs INCREMENTALLY!!!
What does this mean? Implement and test one method at a time.
For each class

Implement one function/method and test it thoroughly (multiple test cases + edge cases if applicable).

Implement the next function/method and test in the same fashion.
How do you do this? Write your own main() function to test your classes. In this course you will never submit your test program, but you must always write one to test your classes. Choose the order in which you implement your methods so that you can test incrementally: i.e. implement mutator functions before accessor functions. Sometimes functions depend on one another. If you need to use a function you have not yet implemented, you can use stubs: a dummy implementation that always returns a single value for testing.  Donâ€™t forget to go back and implement the stub!!! If you put the word STUB in a comment, some editors will make it more visible.
